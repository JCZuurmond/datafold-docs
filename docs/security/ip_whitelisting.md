# Network Security & IP Whitelisting

As an additional security measure, your data warehouse may be restricting IP addresses with an allowlist. You may need to manually add Datafold's addresses in order to use our product.

## IP Whitelisting

For SaaS (app.datafold.com) deployments, you can whitelist the following IP addresses of Datafold:

* `54.71.177.163`
* `35.166.223.86`
