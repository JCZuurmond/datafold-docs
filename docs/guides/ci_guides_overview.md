Continuous integration, or CI, is a well-established practice in software engineering, and is being increasingly adopted by data teams.

CI streamlines code changes from multiple contributors into a single project. Tests and checks are handled automatically, and ensure the new codeâ€™s correctness before integration. By defining and automating this loop, CI can help improve the speed and quality of code changes. 

In organizations without a CI process:
* changes are manually coordinated, and often become a complex synchronization chore.
* testing is done manually, if at all.
* code changes are released at a slower cadence, and with higher rates of failure

A mature CI pipeline:
* enables scaling teams and codebases
* offers high-confidence automated test coverage
* can boost the quantity and quality of developer output

There are many different possible permutations of CI. This guide offers walk-throughs and examples using a few of the most popular tools. 
* [dbt Cloud](ci_guides/dbt_cloud.md)
* [dbt Core](ci_guides/dbt_core.md)
    * [CircleCI](ci_guides/dbt_core/circleci.md)
    * [Github Actions](ci_guides/dbt_core/github_actions.md)
    * [Gitlab CI](ci_guides/dbt_core/gitlab_ci.md)
