Put simply, CI (or Continuous Integration) is a process for building, testing, and deploying changes to your code.

#### Without CI
* changes are manually coordinated, and often become a complex synchronization chore.
* testing is done manually, if at all.
* code changes are released at a slower cadence, and with higher rates of failure.

#### With CI
* smoothly manage code changes, and scale as your team and codebase grows.
* automate high-confidence test coverage.
* boost the quantity and quality of developer output.
