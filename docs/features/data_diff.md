# Data Diff
Data Diff enables teams to become proactive with their data testing and easily allows you to validate migrations before breaking changes have a chance to make it to production. 

Data Diff automates regression testing with integration into the CI process through GitHub and GitLab. With Diff you can validate every source code change so that you can easily see how changes in your code impact the data produced across all rows and columns.

Data Diff checks every change to a data pipeline and highlights how the change in source code will affect the data produced by the pipeline. Save hours of time on manual testing while you avoid regressions in ETL.

Diffs can run automatically on a new code change and flag potential issues directly in your pull request. Using Datafold, you can easily validate the data changes before merging in any potential issues. Let code reviewers, team leadership, and all stakeholders evaluate the impact of a change at a glance.
