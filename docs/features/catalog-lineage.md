Learn more about your data with Datafold's Catalog and Column-level Lineage.

## Catalog
![](../../static/img/catalog_landing.png)
With the Datafold Catalog you can quickly see row counts, nulls and column distributions. We'll gather up this information and display it for every table and data source that you add. 

For more detail, you can sync metadata from dbt and your data warehouse to create a single source of truth. You can implement custom tags to easily categorize and filter the data sets. 

## Column-level Lineage
After connecting your data warehouse Datafold analyzes every SQL statement produces the graph of dependencies to easily visualize your data. See how data is produced and consumed - even correlated subqueries, CASE WHEN statements, and other complex queries are covered.

No additional developer resources are needed, simply connect your data warehouse and you can explore your lineage graph.
